\begin{abstract}\textbf{The birth of nanotechnology in human society was around 2000 years ago and soon found applications in various fields and with nanotechnology nuclear medicine (radiation techniques) are an important tool in fighting against cancer and are used to treat for a variety of malignant tumors of different origins and stage; it is used in the treatment of as many as 50\% of all cancer patients and other then cancer infection/inflammation, and brain and heart diseases also treated with it.Every day in the clinic, nuclear physicians work with nuclear biologists, chemists, and physicists to practise nuclear medicine. Nanomedicine is a medical use of nanomaterials, biologic and nanoelectronic devices, biosensors, and possibly molecular nanotechnology. The fact that radiation dose can be supplied locally and that cells within the radiation nanoparticles transfer radionuclides to tumours while sparing healthy tissues from radiation induced damage account for radiation's efficacy as a cancer treatment technique.Because nanoparticles can be targeted to malignancies, nanotechnology has a promising future in radiotherapy. As a result, scientists have seized on the notion of employing nanoparticles to deliver radionuclides to tumours while avoiding radiation damage to healthy cells. Dendrimer nanocomposites have recently been discovered to be useful in radiation and imaging of tumour microvasculature. Carbon nanoparticles, also known as buckyballs, are barely a nanometer in diameter and could be used as antiradiation medications in the future to assist protect against the negative effects of cancer therapies or dirty bombs.Radiation therapy and chemotherapy frequently harm cells and tissues by releasing potentially harmful reactive oxygen species such as free radicals, oxygen ions, and peroxides. The electron clouds that surround buckyballs are thought to be capable of absorbing these free radicals. In light of a number of recent breakthroughs, the emerging role of nanotechnology in conjunction with radiation biology appears to be highly promising.}\\

\section{Introduction}
nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale to prepare new structures, devices and materials. In general, nanotechnology uses materials sized between 1 and 100 nanometres \cite{hong2009molecular}.The interdisciplinary nature of nanotechnology has given it a fundamental influence in various fields, especially medical science. Nanomedicine is defined as the knowledge and skill of manipulating and exploiting the unique chemical, physical, electrical, optical, and biological attributes of natural or synthesized material at the nano-sized scale for various medical purposes, such as opportune prevention, early detection, and targeted treatment of disease\cite{European,hong2009molecular,moghimi2005nanomedicine,pan2009nanomedicine,ting2010nanotargeted}.\subsection{Cancer application}The mere thought of cancer can be sufficient to elicit images of pain, loss, and
adverse side effects. Cancer may affect people at all ages, even fetuses, but risk for the more common varieties tends to increase with age (Cancer Research UK, 2007). Cancer causes about 13\% of all deaths (WHO, 2006). According to the American Cancer Society, 7.6 million people died from cancer in the world during 2007 (American Cancer Society, 2007). In the U.S. and other developed countries, the U.S. and other developed countries, cancer is presently responsible for about 25\% of all deaths (Jemal et al., 2005).

On an annual basis, cancer affects 0.5 percent of the population. Although developments in diagnostic and therapeutic technology have made it possible to detect cancer at an earlier stage and so treat instances more successfully, present diagnostic and treatment processes are far from ideal, and there is an urgent need to address the numerous flaws. Given the natural history of cancer, the time of diagnosis has a substantial impact on the prognosis, with early detection lowering the risk of morbidity and mortality.
